The code  provided sets up the necessary environment for an information retrieval system. It installs the required packages, imports the necessary modules and classes, and prepares the system for further processing and querying of PDF documents using Chroma DB, LangChain, and the Azure OpenAI API
This code snippet is structured to read authentication credentials and configuration details from a JSON file, initialize an AzureOpenAI client with the provided credentials, and extract the deployment name for a information retrieval task. By loading credentials from an external file, the code ensures secure handling of sensitive information and allows for easy configuration changes without modifying the code directly. The extracted information is then used to set up the AzureOpenAI client for interacting with the Azure OpenAI API, facilitating information retrieval tasks with the specified model and endpoint.
 With all the necessary installations we create a vector database by chunking the input document and then associating each chunk with a vector using an embedding model.
 Teh soiurce file with name 'tesla-annual-reports.zip' is provided to you in this section. Upload it in the google colab environment.  By unzipping the data file, you can access the contents it contains, such as annual reports and financial data that is compressed in the zip file.
 Build a pipeline for loading PDF documents from a directory, extracting the text content, and splitting it into smaller chunks using a recursive character-based text splitter. The resulting chunks can be used for further processing, such as indexing and retrieval.
 With an embedding model and chunking strategy in place, we can set up an information processing pipeline, chunked and passed to the embedding model. The document chunked and embedding is then stored as an entry in the vector database(ChromaDB).
